# primes
Simple C program to search for primes, not perfect, but worked well enough (2004, 05)

The program isn't smart enough to initialise the save file, so one has been included with a few prime numbers in the dat file.

Program will hammer the filesystem, so keep that in mind if you are using COW filesystems like btrfs & zfs.

There are more optimisations that could be found, but has not been touched for over 15 years.
