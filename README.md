# primes
Simple C program to search for primes, not perfect, but worked well enough (2004, 05)

The program isn't smart enough to initialise the save file, so one has been included with a few prime numbers in the dat file.

Program will hammer the filesystem, so keep that in mind.

There are more optimisations that could be found, but has not been touched for over 15 years.
